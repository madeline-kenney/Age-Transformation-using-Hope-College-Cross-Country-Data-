## Key Takeaways 

- Basic features present and consistent; still not a perfect match nor fully realistic representation of aging (ex. highly airbrushed versions). 

- Despite a large time span of 10 years between each output, the model does not seem to capture significant changes between consecutive outputs.

- Interesting patterns: quality diminishes with color variations, such as varying hair tones and face contours/highlights, even though the original photos were high quality; generated output often gives bucked/gapped teeth for age 0 output; generated output often gives wrinkles and eye redness for ages 70-100 outputs.

- Room for improvement and untapped potential for investment, research, and use 

## Introduction

Interested in the capability of being able to look at prior and future versions of oneself, and by the power of vision, I explored age transformation using a style-based age manipulation (SAM) model. To do so, I used my former cross country team's dataset (Hope College Women's 2024 Cross Country Roster data), which included historical photos of each athlete throughout prior seasons on the team. I was specifcally interested in comparing the 20 year old SAM generated output to the real, roster photo of the athletes. 

## Steps 

To do so, the first phase of my project involved scraping the data from Hope College's athletic website (as seen in the code below). The second phase of my project involved running my scraped output (i.e. the jpg photo links for each athelete for each of their seasons on the team) through the SAM model. The specific SAM model that I used is referenced in the "Links" section below. To note, I included both the original SAM model provided as well as a copy of the model that I edited to fit my particular data. The key changes I made to the model include changing the image paths and adding code to slice out for the 20 year old image. The final phase of my project involved comparing the original, real photo of each athlete to specifically the 20 year old age output generated by the SAM model as well as comparing overall the model's regression across a span of 100 years with each output broken up by decade (i.e. a total of 10 output ages for each athlete).

## Value in Further Exploration of Vision
Currently, there's a significant focus on LLMs compared to imaging. For example, of the top-100 most cited AI papers, 83% focused on LLMs and only 17% were related to vision. Additionally, LLMs are driven by large investment and research with the enterprise LLM global market size reaching $6.7 billion in 2024 and $8.8 billion in 2025. With many focused on LLMs, there seems to be untapped potential and attention toward vision capabilities. Some incentives that I believe may drive the imaging space include: (1) society's anti-aging culture with the 2025 global market size in this area reaching $85.12 billion; (2) entertainment and media given for example the high costs associated with CGI and the potential new marketing tactics that could be unlocked with imaging transformation capabilities; and (3) humanity's innate nature and tendency to look into the future as well as connect with the past, which has already been seen within the audio space for example, where apps such as 2wai allow users to 'talk' to deceased loved ones.
